↑ Guru Rinpoche is repeatedly evoked in this prayer by the name Urgyen (Tib. u rgyan), which
is also the name of his home country. For poetic consideration we chose to give his name
both in Tibetan (Urgyen) and Sanskrit (Uḍḍiyāna).↑ Another name for King Indrabhūti.↑ These
are the six pāramitās of 1. generosity, 2. discipline, 3. patience, 4. diligence, 5. meditative
concentration, 6. insight, plus 7. skilful means, 8. strength, 9. aspiration prayers
and 10. wisdom.↑ Chief of all wisdom ḍākinīs who manifest in various forms. She is also
known as Guhyajñānā and Khandro Leki Wangmo.↑ The Kagyé Deshek Düpa, The Gathering of Sugatas
(Tib. bka' brgyad bde gshegs 'dus pa) is a terma-treasure cycle revealed by Nyangrel
Nyima Özer, focusing on the Kagyé. It was revealed at Sinmo Parje Rock in Lhodrak, along with
three statues of the Kagyé, of different sizes.↑ The cave at Tidrö Drak, or Shyotö Tidrö
also known as Kiri Yongdzong, is one of the retreat places where Guru Rinpoche stayed long-term
with Yeshe Tsogyal. It is situated high in the cliffs of a pair of mountains with
hot springs, at an altitude of 5,400m. It was here that Guru Rinpoche later transmitted the
entire ''Dzogchen ''teachings, the ''Innermost, Unsurpassed Cycle of the Category of Pith
Instructions'', and the ''Khandro Nyingtik'' – to a hundred thousand wisdom ḍākinīs and
a single human disciple, Yeshé Tsogyal.↑ The caves at Chimphu represent Guru Rinpoche’s enlightened
speech. He spent long periods there in retreat. The caves are located at the head
of the valley that runs parallel and to the northeast of the Samyé Valley, about 13 km
from Samyé.↑ Khecara (Tib. mkha’ spyod) is the name of the pure realm of Vajravārāhī.
